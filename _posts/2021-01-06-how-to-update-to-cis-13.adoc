== Intro

This guide will walk you through the upgrade process from the 1.2.0 to the 1.3.0 version of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.
If your infrastructure is already compliant with the 1.2.0 version of the Benchmark, and you are looking to upgrade to 1.3.0,
this guide is for you. If you are starting to work on compliance with this benchmark from scratch, check out our
https://gruntwork.io/guides/compliance/how-to-achieve-cis-benchmark-compliance/[How to achieve compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark]
guide instead.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of two main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark 1.3.0 and why it is important to update your code for compatibility.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  The steps you need to take to update your code to be compliant with CIS AWS 1.3.0. It includes a
  <<compatibility_table,version compatibility table>> you can use as a reference to know which Gruntwork Repo version
  tag is compatible with CIS AWS 1.3.0, as well as the manuals step you need to perform to achieve said compliance.


[[core_concepts]]
== Core Concepts

=== Background

The 1.3.0 version of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark was released in September of 2020. You can refer to the
https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/[CIS website] where you can download the latest version of the
Benchmark (as well as all the previous versions). The latest version introduces several new recommendations, and this guide
will walk you through implementing these using Gruntwork's Infrastructure as Code Library,
so that your infrastructure is fully compliant with version 1.3.0 of the framework.

==== New recommendations
These are the new recommendations introduced in version 1.3.0 of the Benchmark. You can think of these as a "diff"
between versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.0:

- 1.19: Ensure that all the expired SSL/TLS certificates stored in AWS IAM are removed
- 1.20: Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with ‘Block public access (bucket settings)’
- 1.21: Ensure that IAM Access analyzer is enabled
- 2.1.1: Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest
- 2.1.2: Ensure S3 Bucket Policy allows HTTPS requests
- 2.2.1: Ensure EBS volume encryption is enabled
- 3.10: Ensure that object-level logging for write events is enabled for (CloudTrail) S3 bucket
- 3.11: Ensure that object-level logging for read events is enabled for (CloudTrail) S3 bucket
- 4.15: Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exists for AWS Organizations changes
- 5.1: Ensure no network ACLs allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to remote server administration ports

==== New Gruntwork modules vs existing modules
To achieve compliance with the newly added 10 recommendations listed above, we created four new modules in the
Gruntwork's Infrastructure as Code Library, and updated a bunch of existing modules. Namely: recommendations 1.19, 1.21,
2.2.1 and 5.1 required the creation of new modules; the rest of the recommendations were achieved by updating existing modules.

To ensure compliance with the version 1.3.0 of the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, you'll need to follow all the
instructions in the <<deployment_walkthrough>> section of this guide; specifically, follow Steps 1 and 2 to ensure that
the existing modules get updated to their CIS 1.3.0 compliant versions, and follow Step 3 to ensure that you install and
configure the newly created modules.

[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment walkthrough

=== Step 1: Update references to the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library

In order to update to the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.3.0, you need to update your references to the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library to use compatible versions. We (Gruntwork) have reviewed and updated all the modules in the
library for compatibility with the new version of the Benchmark. As a customer, you need to update to
the proper versions of the Gruntwork library to pick up the fixes/changes that were made to be compatible. Refer to
https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#updating[the
"Updating" section of "How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library"] for instructions on how to update the
versions in your code.

For the vast majority of the repos, the only change that will be necessary is a version number bump, but several repos
require more extensive code changes and state migrations. To upgrade without downtime and data loss, **you MUST follow
the migration instructions in the release notes in each repo to know what changes need to be made to update to the new
version.**

[.exceptional]
IMPORTANT: Gruntwork follows
https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#versioning[semantic
versioning]. For any pre-1.0 modules, this means that version updates to the minor version are considered backwards
incompatible releases for any version updates prior to 1.0.0 release. Make sure to read the release notes for the
relevant modules any time you are updating minor versions! Note that you will want to read the release notes for each
minor version that is updated (e.g., if you are going from v0.5.x to v0.9.x, you will want to read the notes for v0.6.0,
v0.7.0, v0.8.0, and v0.9.0 to get the full list of backwards incompatible updates).

The following table provides a summary of all the relevant Gruntwork AWS modules and the respective versions that are
compatible with CIS AWS 1.3.0:

=== Step 2: Manual steps

Recommendation 4.15 requires an active subscriber for the SNS topic created by this recommendation (see Audit steps 6
and 7 for 4.15). As it's impossible to automate creation of this subscriber, you'll have to do so manually. See
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html[Subscribing to an Amazon SNS topic]
on the AWS website for detailed instructions.


=== Step 3: Deploy new modules

==== 1. Deploy the Cleanup Expired Certs module (recommendation 1.19)

The new CIS v1.3 recommendations require that all expired SSL/TLS certificates stored in AWS IAM are automatically removed. Removing expired SSL/TLS certificates eliminates the risk that an invalid certificate will be deployed
accidentally to a resource such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), which can damage the credibility of the application/website behind the ELB. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete expired certificates. To help you
achieve this recommendation check out the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-cis-service-catalog/tree/master/examples/cleanup-expired-certs/terraform[example] of the ready-made `cleanup-expired-certs` module.

==== 2. Deploy IAM Access Analyzer module (recommendation 1.21)

The updated recommendations also require that the AWS IAM Access Analyzer service is enabled across all active regions in a given AWS account or organization.

Once enabled and active, this service will examine the trust policies and access to the following resources:

- Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets;
- AWS Identity and Access Management roles;
- AWS Key Management Service keys;
- AWS Lambda functions and layers;
- Amazon Simple Queue Service queues.

The IAM Access Analyzer will scan only within the boundaries of the AWS Account or Organization it has been enabled for. The results from this scan will be visible and accessible through the AWS CLI and the AWS Web console. For more information and details on what the AWS IAM Access Analyzer can achieve for your AWS Account and Organization, please refer to the official https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html[AWS docs].

To help you achieve CIS 1.3 compliance, you can find examples of how to use the ready-made module as part of the `landingzone` module in the `terraform-aws-service-catalog` repository https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/releases/tag/v0.15.4[v0.15.4], and specifically the `account-baseline-root` and `account-baseline-security` https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-service-catalog/tree/v0.15.4/examples/for-learning-and-testing/landingzone[examples].

==== 3. Deploy the ebs-encryption-multi-region module (recommendation 2.2.1)

EC2 supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service. While disabled by default, forcing encryption when creating EBS volumes is supported. Encrypting data at rest reduces the likelihood that it is
unintentionally exposed and can nullify the impact of disclosure if the encryption remains unbroken. Recommendation 2.2.1 specifies a manual process to encrypt EBS volumes using the AWS Console, however Gruntwork has developed
a module that configures volume encryption by default in all enabled regions. Check out the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/tree/master/modules/ebs-encryption-multi-region[ebs-encryption-multi-region] to
configure AWS EBS encryption in all enabled regions of an AWS Account.

==== 4. Deploy the vpc-app-network-acl and vpc-mgmt-network-acl modules (recommendation 5.1)

If you are already using the `vpc-app-network-acl` and/or `vpc-mgmt-network-acl` modules, you need to update the
source URL from the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc[`terraform-aws-vpc` module] (previously known
as `module-vpc`). There is one new required argument, `allow_administrative_remote_access_cidrs`. You will add the
CIDRs from your office!

[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc_app_network_acls" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-cis-service-catalog.git//modules/vpc-app-network-acls?ref=v0.10.0"

  # ... the existing variables weren't affected!

  allow_administrative_remote_access_cidrs = {
    berlin_office = "1.2.3.4/32"
    ny_office     = "6.7.8.9/32"
  }
}
----

Note that these new Network ACL Rules exceed the default AWS Quota for NACL Rules. We created a Terraform module
(https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/tree/master/modules/request-quota-increase[`request-quota-increase`])
where you can request a quota increase. If you use two remote administration ports (the defaults for both modules
are 22 (SSH) and 3389 (Remote Desktop)), you can add up to 10 CIDRs. Check out
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-cis-service-catalog/tree/v0.10.0/modules/vpc-app-network-acls#calculating-nacl-rules-limits[our
docs] to see how to calculate the maximum number of CIDRs that you can add.
