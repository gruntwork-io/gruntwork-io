== ecr-repos Service Migration Guide

Follow this guide to update the `ecr-repos` module to the Service Catalog.

=== Estimated Time to Migrate: 10 minutes per environment

=== Repositories Input

Configure the new `repositories` input.

This input consolidates the `repo_names`, `external_account_ids_with_read_access` and
`external_account_ids_with_write_access` inputs from the old module into a single object.

At this point you can also configure defaults for `default_external_account_ids_with_read_access` and
`default_external_account_ids_with_write_access`.

You can configure these new inputs to use the same values as what you had for the old variables.

For example, if you had:

[source,python]
----
inputs = {
  repo_names = [
    "sample-app-frontend",
    "sample-app-backend",
  ]

  external_account_ids_with_read_access = [
    "012345678901",
  ]
  external_account_ids_with_write_access = [
    "123456789012",
  ]
}
----

Convert this to:

[source,python]
----
inputs = {
  repositories = {
    "sample-app-frontend"          = {},
    "sample-app-backend"           = {},
  }

  default_external_account_ids_with_read_access = [
    "012345678901",
  ]
  default_external_account_ids_with_write_access = [
    "123456789012",
  ]
}
