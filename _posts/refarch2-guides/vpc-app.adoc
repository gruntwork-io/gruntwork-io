== VPC Service Migration Guide

Follow this guide to update the VPC module to the Service Catalog.

Cross-reference with the example changes shown in these patches:
* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme/blob/master/dev/us-east-1/dev/vpc/ref-arch-v1-to-service-catalog-migration.patch[vpc (dev)]

=== Estimated Time to Migrate: 30 minutes per environment

=== New Required Inputs

Configure these new inputs to migrate to the Service Catalog version of the module. They are now required.

* `vpc_name`: Set this to the name of the VPC.

=== Inputs for Backward Compatibility

Configure the following new inputs to ensure your service continues to function with minimal interruption. These are
necessary to maintain backward compatibility. _If left unset, you will risk redeploying the service and causing
downtime._

First add a `[dependency`
block](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#dependency) for your management VPC.

For example, if you had the following:

[source,bash]
----
dependencies {
  paths = [
    "../../mgmt/vpc",
  ]
}
----

Convert this to:

[source,bash]
----
dependency "mgmt_vpc" {
  config_path = "../../mgmt/vpc"
}
----

Also set the following inputs:

* `create_peering_connection`: Set this to `true`
* `origin_vpc_id`: Set this to the `vpc_id` of the dependency VPC. In this example, it would be
`dependency.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_id`.
* `origin_vpc_name`: Set this to the `vpc_name` of the dependency VPC. In this example, it would be
`dependency.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_name`.
* `origin_vpc_cidr_block`: Set this to the `vpc_cidr_block` of the dependency VPC. In this example, it would be
`dependency.mgmt_vpc.outputs.vpc_cidr_block`.
* `origin_vpc_route_table_ids`: This is a concatenated list of outputs from the dependency VPC. In this example, it
would be
`concat( dependency.mgmt_vpc.outputs.private_subnet_route_table_ids, [dependency.mgmt_vpc.outputs.public_subnet_route_table_id] )`

=== State Migration Script

Run the link:./scripts/migrate_vpc_app.sh[provided migration script] to migrate the state in a backward compatible way.

=== Breaking Changes

* This change is fully backward compatible. You will notice the creation of two resources: `aws_default_network_acl` and
`aws_default_security_group` . This can be safely ignored.
