      legalese: |
        <p><strong>1.1. Revisions.</strong> We may revise these Terms or any additional terms and conditions which are relevant to a particular Service from time-to-time. We will post the revised terms to our website (currently <a rel="internal" rel="internal" href="/terms/" title="Grountwork Terms of Service">https://gruntwork.io/terms</a>) (the “Website”) with a “last updated” date, and we will attempt to notify you of any material updates to these Terms via email or through the Services. IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICES AFTER THE REVISIONS TAKE EFFECT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE REVISED TERMS. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification of the Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2. Notifying You of Updates.</strong> You agree to receive electronically all communications, agreements, and notices that we provide in connection with any Services (“Communications”), including by email, by posting them to our website, or through any Services. You agree that all Communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such Communications be in writing and you agree to keep your Account contact information current.</p>

        We might update these Terms of Service at some point, and if we do, we'll proactively notify you about it.

    - title: 2. Authorized Users
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>2.1. Definition.</strong> An “Authorized User” shall mean your employee or contractor who is granted per-user access rights to the Services, and shall include accounts with such access rights used primarily for performing automated tasks (commonly called “machine users”). You are entitled to up to the maximum number of Authorized Users specified at the time of purchase. Every individual that accesses the Services during the term of this Agreement must be an Authorized User.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2. Adding/Removing Users.</strong> If you wish to increase the maximum number of Authorized Users, you must purchase licenses for the additional Authorized Users from Gruntwork at the price as specified in section 4.1. Authorized Users may be added and removed by contacting Gruntwork at <a rel="internal" href="mailto:support@gruntwork.io" title="Email Gruntwork Support">support@gruntwork.io</a> or via a web interface specified by Gruntwork in the future.</p>
      plain:  |
        An Authorized User is a human or machine user that accesses our private repos, training materials, or support services. Email <a rel="internal" href="mailto:support@gruntwork.io" title="Email Gruntwork Support">support@gruntwork.io</a> to add/remove users.

    - title: 3. Additional Terms for the Services

      plain:  |
        Our individual products and services each have their own supplemental terms. Scroll down to see them!

    - title: 4. Compensation and Invoicing
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.1. Pricing.</strong> In consideration for the Services, you will pay Gruntwork as provided in the applicable terms for the specific Services you have chosen to subscribe to. The price you pay for specific Services will be the prices as published on our Website at the time you first register for the Services, which will remain your prices throughout the term of this Agreement (including any renewal periods).  Gruntwork is free to change the pricing of the Services at any time during the term of this Agreement, but the new pricing shall only apply to you for any renewal period if you notify Gruntwork before the beginning of such renewal period of your request for the new pricing.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2. Incidental Expenses.</strong> If performing the Services involves incidental expenses, you will only be responsible for such incidental expenses if you previously approved the expenses in writing (email is sufficient).</p>
      plain:  |
        All our pricing is published at <a target="_blank" rel="internal" href="/pricing" title="Gruntwork Pricing">https://gruntwork.io/pricing</a>, and we don't charge any hidden fees. We won't change the price you pay for our services unless:<br />(1) we announce new pricing, AND<br  />(2) you ask us to apply the new pricing to your next renewal period.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.3. Billing for Subscription Services.</strong> Unless the terms for a specific subscription-based Service expressly provides otherwise for that particular Service, when you first sign up for the Services, Gruntwork will automatically charge you a $500 initial deposit, and Gruntwork will review your order for Services and approve or reject your order.  Once Gruntwork has approved your order, on the approval date, Gruntwork will automatically charge you the subscription fees owed for the upcoming month of Services, and then will charge you the subscription fees owed for each subsequent month on the earlier of (a) the same day of each subsequent month or (b) the last day of such subsequent month. This payment shall be made by credit card.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4. Billing for Non-Subscription Services.</strong> For any payments you owe other than monthly subscription fees, including approved incidental expenses, Gruntwork will charge your credit card, unless the payment is for more than $5,000, in which case we will invoice you, and you will make payment on such invoice via check, ACH or wire transfer within 15 days of your receipt of the invoice.</p>
      plain:  |
        When you submit your order, we'll immediately charge you a $500 initial deposit, regardless of the services you ordered. Soon after, a Grunt will review your order, and once it's approved, we'll charge your credit card any remaining amounts you owe for your first month of service.<br /><br /> Going forward, we'll bill you automatically by credit card on the same day of the month that we approved your order.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>4.5. Late Payments.</strong> Late payments will be subject to a 1.5% fee per month, or the highest amount permitted by law, whichever is lower. You will pay for all costs incurred in the collection of past-due amounts owed to Gruntwork, including any legal fees.</p>
      plain:  |
        If you're late with your payments, you'll owe us a late fee and have to cover our costs of collecting from you.

    - title: 5. Term and Termination
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.1. Master Terms.</strong> These Terms apply to you so long as you use any of the Services, and will continue until terminated pursuant to this section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of these Terms does not result in the termination of the terms of service applicable to specific Services. Each of the terms of service applicable to specific Services is subject to its own term as set forth in those terms of service, and these Terms shall continue to apply for specific Services until the terms of service for those specific Services terminates.</p>
      plain:  |
        We have "master terms" that cover all our products and service, plus each product or service has its own additional terms. You can cancel individual products or services without canceling other products or services or these master terms.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>5.2. Termination for Convenience.</strong> Either Gruntwork or you may terminate these Terms at any time by giving 30 days’ written notice to the other of such termination.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3. Termination for Breach.</strong> Either Gruntwork or you may also terminate these Terms at any time upon the material breach of these Terms by the other Party with at least 14 days' prior written notice to the other Party, provided that the material breach has not been cured prior to the end of the notice period. Any such termination must clearly identify these Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4. Upon Termination</strong> In the event of termination of these Terms by Client, Gruntwork will be due full compensation for all Services performed through the termination date (including approved expenses) within 15 days of the termination date. You and Gruntwork each reserve all rights, including all intellectual property rights or other rights as set out in section 6 below, under these Terms in the event of any such termination.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can terminate these master terms any time with 30 days' notice (or, if we fail to live up to this agreement, with 14 days' notice), but keep in mind that the specific product or service you ordered may have a different term. For example, the Gruntwork Subscription has an annual subscription.<br /><br />If you do terminate, you'll still owe us any amounts you owed us before terminating.

    - title: 6. Intellectual Property Rights
      legalese: |
        <p id="customer-license"><strong>6.1. Customer License.</strong> Subject to the terms of service of the applicable specific Services you have subscribed to, and provided that you pay Gruntwork all amounts owed pursuant to these Terms and such other terms of service and that you are not in breach of any provision of these Terms or such other terms of service, Gruntwork hereby grants to you a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (other than as specifically set forth in section 15 below), non-sublicensable license for your Authorized Users to use, install, test, execute, perform, and copy the Services exclusively for your business use, and to create derivative works or otherwise modify the Services (including source code of the Services) purely for your own purposes (the “License”).</p>
        <p><strong>6.2. License is Private to Customer.</strong> Gruntwork does not grant you a license, and you acknowledge that you are not permitted to sell, distribute, or publish in any way (under an open source license or otherwise) to any other party without express written permission from Gruntwork, any portion of the Services (including any source code of the Services) or any derivative or modification of the Services created by you, even if Gruntwork otherwise publishes or redistributes (under an open source license or otherwise) the Services or any portion thereof.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3. Limited Rights Transfer.</strong> Gruntwork does not transfer any rights to any portion of the Services to you or any third party, and delivery of any Services to you shall not constitute any transfer of rights, except as set forth in this section 6. Gruntwork retains all rights unless enumerated otherwise herein.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can do anything you want with our code and training as long as only Authorized Users access it and you use it for your company only. In particular, you cannot share our code or training with another company, resell it, publish it as open source, or try to sub-license it.<br /><br />Each person on your team who accesses our code, training, or support must be an Authorized User. For example, we don't allow the use of a single GitHub profile that's shared by multiple individuals.<br /><br />Note that, per <a href="#post-termination-rights">Gruntwork Subscription / Section 1.5</a>, our license allows you to keep using the code even if you cancel! Just make sure that you never directly compete with us (per <a href="#non-compete">section 12</a>).

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.4. Gruntwork Retains Ownership.</strong> Gruntwork retains all rights to all works (including source code, object code, user interfaces, documentation, or other works), algorithms, data, inventions, discoveries, ideas, designs, trade secrets, tangible or intangible, embodied in the Services or created or reduced to practice in performance of the Services, including without limitation all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights to and in the Services in the United States and all other countries, including the right to pursue patents, utility models, or industrial design applications in the United States and all other countries. No portion of the Services is developed as a “work-made-for-hire”, as defined by the Copyright Law of the United States, for you, and such Services shall be exclusively owned by Gruntwork.</p>
      plain:  |
        We give you a very permissive license to the code, but we remain the official owners of it.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.5. Use with Other Customers.</strong> Gruntwork reserves the right to use the Services or any portion thereof for any and all purposes. Gruntwork intends and reserves the right, and you hereby acknowledge Gruntwork’s intent and right, to incorporate the Services or any portion thereof into projects for customers other than you, and, without limitation, to license the Services or any portion thereof to other customers of Gruntwork and to other third parties.</p>
      plain:  |
        We plan to share this code with other customers just like you!

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.6. Customer Contributions to Gruntwork.</strong> Nothing in these Terms requires you to contribute to the Services; however, if you choose to contribute any intellectual property via a submission to a Gruntwork source code repository (for example, via a GitHub pull request), Gruntwork will own such contribution (“Gruntwork-Owned Contribution”). You warrant that Gruntwork-Owned Contributions do not include any of your Confidential Information (as defined in section 7), and you hereby assign to Gruntwork all rights in the Gruntwork-Owned Contribution, including without limitation all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights to and in the Services in the United States and all other countries, including the right to pursue patents, utility models, or industrial design applications in the United States and all other countries, and will do everything reasonably possible (when requested by Gruntwork, and at Gruntwork’s expense) to carry out in good faith the intent of this clause. Nothing in these Terms requires you to provide access to Gruntwork to your source code repository, unless otherwise expressly required under the terms of service of a specific Service that you have utilized.</p>
        <p><strong>6.7. Private Customer Intellectual Property.</strong> If you create intellectual property and do not contribute it to a Gruntwork source code repository (for example, if you only contribute intellectual property to your own source code repository or to your private fork of a Gruntwork source code repository), you will continue to own such intellectual property (“Customer Intellectual Property”).  Gruntwork shall have no ownership or other rights in Customer Intellectual Property.</p>
      plain:  |
        Anything you do with our code in your own code repos is your intellectual property and we will not have any rights to it.<br /><br />But if you find a bug in our code or see an opportunity for an improvement, you might want to contribute some code back to us. If you do that, we'll want to share that code with all our customers. So if you open a Pull Request on one of our GitHub repos, we'll own the code you submit.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.8. Gruntwork Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You acknowledge that Gruntwork may from time-to-time utilize third-party software, such as publicly-distributed software (e.g., third-party software commonly known as “free software” or “open source software” subject to one or more third-party license agreements), or other third-party documentation and information in generating the Services or otherwise providing products or services to you under these Terms. Gruntwork may incorporate such third-party software into the Services or make use of such third-party software in the Services. If the third-party software uses a GPL, LGPL, or MPL license, Gruntwork will ensure the use of that third-party software in the Services does not trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations.</p>
      plain:  |
        Some of the code in our library contains open source tools that use a "copyleft" license like GPL (e.g. <code>curl</code>). We won't modify these tools in such a way that we trigger a "viral" obligation that requires our code (or your derivative works from our cdoe) to be released as GPL.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>6.9. Your Use of Open Source Software.</strong> You also acknowledge that, under the terms of the License granted herein, you agree not to distribute the Services or any derivative of the Services in any way and, as such, acknowledges and agrees that you will not “convey” any Services or derivative of the Services in a manner that would trigger GPL and LGPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. In the event that you produce any derivative work from any portion of the Services, or otherwise modify the Services, you shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such derivatives or modifications comply with the terms of the licenses to any third-party software incorporated into the Services.</p>
      plain:  |
        In section 6.8, we make a commitment to you not to modify any open source code to trigger a "viral" obligation.<br /><br />Here, we ask you to do the same. In practice, this means that if you modify our code, you can't modify any GPL code that we distribute with the code. For example, we use <code>curl</code> in many of our bash scripts. If you need to make a change to how we use <code>curl</code>, don't modify <code>curl</code> itself because the GPL license on <code>curl</code> will then require that all the code that uses <code>curl</code> be made GPL as well.<br /><br /><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don't modify source code written by a third party when you submit a Pull Request to us.

    - title: 7. Confidentiality
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.1 Mutual Non-Disclosure.</strong> You and Gruntwork acknowledge that during the course of Gruntwork performing the Services, each Party may disclose information that is confidential and proprietary to such Party, its vendors or its customers (“Confidential Information”) to the other Party to facilitate work under these Terms. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence. You and Gruntwork agree that each of you will only use the other Party’s Confidential Information as expressly authorized by these Terms, and in the preparation of the Services or in integrating the Services with your other products, and will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the written permission of the Party disclosing the Confidential Information. </p>
      plain:  |
        We won't share any confidential information about you, and you agree not to share any confidential information about us, including our code.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.2 Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Each Party will protect Confidential Information disclosed to it by taking reasonable precautions to avoid disclosure which are at least as restrictive as the precautions it uses to protect its own proprietary information, but in no event less than reasonable care, and will limit access to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to those of its employees or agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The foregoing are collectively referred to herein as the “Obligations of Confidentiality.”</p>
      plain:  |
        We'll each treat each other's confidential information at least as carefully as we treat our own.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.3. Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> The Obligations of Confidentiality shall apply regardless of the form the Confidential Information takes. To be treated as Confidential Information under this section, written information must be marked as “Confidential Information” in writing at the time of its transmittal. Confidential Information disclosed orally or in any form other than a document must be identified as proprietary at the time of disclosure and then described in a writing, suitably marked as “Confidential Information”, provided to the receiving Party within 30 days of the disclosure. Confidential information will not include information that:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>was already known to the Party to which it is disclosed before its disclosure under these Terms;</li>
          <li>is or becomes publicly known without breach of these Terms;</li>
          <li>is developed by a receiving Party independently without reference to the relevant confidential information of the disclosing Party;</li>
          <li>is obtained from third parties, which have no obligations to keep confidential to the Parties to these Terms.</li>
        </ol>
      plain:  |
        This is a pretty typical definition of Confidential Information, and what's specifically not considered Confidential Information.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>7.4. Mandatory Disclosure.</strong> The Parties may disclose Confidential Information to comply with applicable law or in response to a valid order of requirement by a court or other governmental body, provided that the receiving Party gives the disclosing Party prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order.</p>
        <p><strong>7.5. Survival of Obligations Upon Termination.</strong> The Obligation of Confidentiality will survive termination of these Terms for three years.</p>
        <p><strong>7.6. Included in Gruntwork Confidential Information.</strong> You agree that the Services and all portions thereof is Confidential Information of Gruntwork unless or until publicly disclosed or publicly distributed by Gruntwork.</p>
      plain:  |
        If a government body tells either of us we have to disclose the other's confidential information, we'll do it, but we'll make sure to update the other party on what happened.

    - title: 8. Limited Liability
      legalese: |
        <p>Gruntwork's total liability to you under these Terms, and all other terms of service for specific Services, for damages, costs, and expenses will not exceed the compensation received by Gruntwork under these Terms for the 12-month period prior to any claim. Gruntwork will not be liable for your lost profits or special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if you have been advised by Gruntwork of the possibility of such damages. You and Gruntwork agree to this limitation even if the remedy for any breach of this contract fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    - title: 9. Indemnifications
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>9.1. Indemnification by You.</strong> You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Gruntwork and its members, employees, and agents from and against any third party liability, claims, demands, damages, judgments, losses and expenses of any nature, including legal expenses and attorney’s fees, arising out of any theory of liability (including tort, warranty, or strict liability) or out of damage to any property, related in any way to your use of the Services or exercise of the rights granted under these Terms except to the extent the claim is subject to Gruntwork’s indemnification obligation set forth in section 9.2.</p>
      plain:  |
        If someone else sues us or has any other claim against us for something that's really your fault and not ours, you'll defend and cover us.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>9.2. Indemnification by Gruntwork.</strong> Gruntwork will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you and your members, employees, and agents from and against any third party liability, claims, demands, damages, judgments, losses and expenses of any nature, including legal expenses and attorney’s fees, arising out of any theory of liability (including tort, warranty, or strict liability) or out of damage to any property, due to any third party claim alleging that the Services, as delivered, infringes, misappropriates or violates any third party U.S. copyrights, trademarks or patent rights.</p>
      plain:  |
        If someone else sues you because our code or services infringe on their intellectual property rights, we'll defend and cover you.

    - title: 10. Representations and Warranties
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>10.1. Representations and Warranties by You.</strong> You hereby represent and warrant to Gruntwork as follows: (1) you have the authority to enter into these Terms and to bind the entity you have listed (if any) on the registration form for the Services to these Terms, and that these Terms constitute your and its legal, valid, binding and enforceable agreement; and (2) execution and performance of these Terms (i) does not breach any agreement of yours or the entity’s with any third party, or any duty arising in law or equity, (ii) does not violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to you or the entity and (iii) are within your and its powers.</p>
      plain:  |

      plain:  |
        We'll do a good job with our services to you, and we won't violate any other agreements or the law in providing them.

    - title:
      legalese: |
        <p><strong>10.3. Limitations.</strong> EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.2, GRUNTWORK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, GRUNTWORK PROVIDES NO WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, MEET ANY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY STANDARDS, OR BE ERROR FREE.</p>
      plain:  |
        We are not stating anything else to you about the quality of our services beyond what we say in section 10.2.

    - title: 11. Independent Contractor
      legalese: |
        <p>You and Gruntwork are independent parties and nothing in these Terms will constitute either Party or their employees as the employer, principal, or partner of or joint venture with the other Party. Neither you nor Gruntwork has any authority to assume or create any obligation or liability, either express or implied, on behalf of the other.</p>
      plain:  |
        We're not going to become an employee of yours, but we are grateful to become your vendor!

    - title: <span id="non-compete">12. Use of Services to Compete</span>
      legalese: |
        <p>You warrant that you are not in the business of offering, designing, selling, or otherwise distributing reusable infrastructure modules to software companies, and further agree that you will not offer, design, sell, or otherwise distribute reusable infrastructure modules to software companies located in any jurisdiction, so long as Gruntwork is in the business of offering, designing, selling, or otherwise distributing reusable infrastructure modules to software companies. In the event that Gruntwork, at its sole discretion and in good faith, determines that you are competing with Gruntwork in violation of this clause, Gruntwork may, as its sole remedy, terminate these Terms and any and all terms of service for any specific Services upon notice to you, and you shall immediately cease use of all Gruntwork intellectual property upon such termination.</p>
      plain:  |
        If you compete with us by selling reusable infrastructure modules, we will immediately terminate your license.

    - title: 13. Force Majeure
      legalese: |
        <p>No failure or omission by either Party in the performance of any obligation of these Terms will be deemed a breach of these Terms or create any liability if the same will arise from any cause or causes beyond the control of such Party, including, but not limited to, the following: acts of god; acts or omissions of any government; any rules, regulations or orders issued by any governmental authority or by any officer, department, agency or instrumentality thereof; fire; storm; flood; earthquake; accident; war; rebellion; insurrection; riot; and invasion; provided that such Party provides notice to the other Party of such an event and such failure or omission resulting from one of the above causes is cured as soon as is practicable.</p>
      plain:  |
        If an earthquake or some other kind of major crisis occurs and we can't deliver our services to you, you can't consider that a breach of contract, as long as we deliver on our commitment to you as soon as we reasonably can.

    - title: 14. Notices

    - title: 15. Assignment
      legalese: |
        <p>Neither Party will assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, or its rights and obligations herein, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void; provided, however, that either Party may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, or other operation of law, without the consent of the other Party. The terms of these Terms will be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
      plain:  |
        You can't assign this agreement to someone else, but if you're acquired by or merged with another company, the agreement will transfer to the new company.

    - title: 16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
      legalese: |
        <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware. The Parties agree that any disputes related to these Terms not otherwise resolved as set forth in this section 16 will be brought and maintained exclusively in the federal and state courts of the State of Delaware. If any controversy, claim or dispute arises out of or relating to these Terms, including the breach or interpretation of these Terms or the terms of service for any specific Services (collectively, a “Dispute”), each Party shall designate an executive who is authorized to investigate, negotiate and settle the Dispute. The executives shall exercise good faith efforts to settle the Dispute. If the executives do not resolve the Dispute within 30 days (or an extended period if they so agree) of the initial notice of the Dispute from one Party to the other, then the Parties may pursue the Dispute in courts in accordance with this section. No court or other action pertaining to a Dispute shall be pursued unless this dispute resolution procedure has been exhausted. Nonetheless, either Party at any time may pursue equitable relief before any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its intellectual property rights or Confidential Information.</p>
      plain:  |
        If we have a dispute, we'll attempt to settle it directly with each other for at least 30 days. If that fails, either of us can bring a court action in the state of Delaware, which is generally considered to have well-defined business laws.

    - title: 17. Miscellaneous
      legalese: |
        <p>These Terms and any and all terms of service of the specific Services you register for or otherwise utilize constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties, and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of these Terms; provided, however, that if you or your organization is bound by an MSA, then these Terms will apply, if at all, only to the use of the Services to the extent such use is not already governed by the MSA. The failure to exercise any right provided in these Terms by a Party will not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights by such Party. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect, and the Parties will, in good faith, attempt to modify the invalid provision so it becomes a valid provision.</p>
      plain:  |
        This agreement overrides any other verbal or other written agreement we might have, unless we have an existing Master Services Agreement, in which case this agreement only adds to to the Master Services Agreement but does not take away anything.
