    <h2>The most secure way to do CI / CD for app and infrastructure code</h2>
    <p style="border: 1px solid #194c5f; background-color: #242e3b; padding: 15px 20px;">
      Gruntwork Pipelines is a code framework and approach that enables you
      to use your preferred CI tool to set up an end-to-end pipeline for infrastructure 
      code (Terraform) and app code (Docker, Packer, Kubernetes).
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipelines includes first-class support for governance, GitOps, automated Terraform
      tests, promotion workflows, approval workflows, and auditing, all built with security
      in mind from day one. And as with most Gruntwork products, all configuration is defined as code.
