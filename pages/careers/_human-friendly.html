    <h2>Gruntwork is a Human-Friendly Company.</h2>
    <p>We aim to build a company:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where you get to take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable.</li>
      <li>Where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement is welcome.</li>
      <li>Where the team takes great pride in our craft, but also gets things done.</li>
      <li>Where we are all focused on advancing the company's mission, but get plenty of time off.</li>
      <li>That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all cultures, genders, and races.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, <strong>we want to work on interesting problems, with interesting people, while leading interesting lives.</strong></p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Our benefits reflect our values. We believe compensation should be fair, transparent, and generous.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Above-Market Salary.</strong> We compute your salary <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-hire-at-gruntwork-42193d583e24">formulaically</a> with the aim to systematically pay above market.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit-Sharing Bonus.</strong> We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Bonus.</strong> We give performance-based bonuses as often as once a quarter, depending on your performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Progressive Equity.</strong> We grant "<a href="https://medium.com/detour-dot-com/introducing-progressive-equity-f424a51ee3a4">"progressive equity</a> to all new Grunts. This means that, in the case of a large exit (e.g., acquisition), the financial benefits get distributed more evenly across the whole team rather than solely going to the founders.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Insurance.</strong> We offer high-quality plans, including some with no deductible through JustWorks.com. We cover 80% of your personal health insurance costs and more than half of those of your family.</li>
      <li><strong>Dental Insurance.</strong> We offer high-quality plans and pay for 100% of the cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Vision Insurance.</strong> We offer high-quality plans and pay for 100% of the cost.</li>
      <li><strong>FSA and HSAs.</strong> We don't contribute to these accounts, but we do offer them as an option.</li>
      <li><strong>401(k).</strong> We contribute 3% of your salary to your 401(k), regardless of how much you contribute yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Disability insurance.</strong> If you get disabled, we have a policy that will pay out a portion of your salary.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware budget.</strong> We'll buy you a brand new 16" Apple MacBook Pro (or other computer of your choosing of equivalent value) upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Budget.</strong> We'll give you a personal budget of $500/month to spend on improving your health, productivity, or knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimum Vacation.</strong> We require that you take at least 4 weeks of vacation per year.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The above benefits reflect our offering package for Grunts based in the USA. For Grunts based in other countries, we make every effort to offer an equivalent total package specific to that country.</em></p>

    <h3>100% Remote</h3>
    <p>Gruntwork is a remote-first company.</p>

    <h3>Sane Working Hours</h3>
    <p>Although we're a distributed team, we only hire candidates between the time zones of GMT-7 (San Francisco) and GMT+2 (Berlin). This means you'll never be separated by more than 9 hours from your colleagues and never pressured to work at crazy hours just to get your work done.</p>
    <p>We also plan project teams based on geography so that most of your collaboration will be with team members in a similar time zone.</p>
