      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently
      looking for:

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on
        <a

          target="_blank"
          >toil</a
        >
        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document tribal knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems
        are mitigated for future users.

    <h3>Senior Product Designer</h3>

    <p>Help us make Gruntwork delightful!</p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Gruntwork Portal.</strong> We're building a SaaS platform that will be the primary customer experience of our product. Today, customers access Gruntwork via private GitHub repos plus a patchwork of links to training and documentation. Working with you, we envision a unified portal where customers login to discover and use all the elements of our product.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Improved Docs.</strong> For products targeting developers, the docs <em>are</em> the product. Working with you, we envision unifying our <a href="https://gruntwork.io/guides">sprawling</a> <a href="https://gruntwork.io/repos/v0.20.4/terraform-aws-eks">set</a> <a href="https://gruntwork.io/devops-checklist/">of</a> <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/">thorough</a> <a href="https://gruntwork.io/repos/v0.4.1/cis-compliance-aws">documentation</a> into a single "Gruntwork Docs" site that streamlines the user experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Developer Self-Service.</strong> You'll own the user experience and product design for a completely new product. On the surface, it's a simple web interface that our customers' Dev teams can use to deploy and manage infrastructure. Under the hood, the web interface and how it manages infrastructure are completely defined and controlled by the Ops team using infrastructure as code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Branding and Marketing.</strong> You'll be the owner of Gruntwork's public face to the world. How do we tell the world what we do? How do we explain and showcase our highly technical products in a way that visitors can understand? How do we convert visitors to leads?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Design system.</strong> You'll be our first full-time designer so you will set the design direction for the entire company across all areas of design, working directly with the founders and closely with engineers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although you'll be the only professional designer on the team, our company cares deeply about design so you'll have many eager collaborators when it comes time to brainstorm.</p>

    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Product sensibility.</strong> We're looking for a product designer—someone who can be an equal partner in helping us design and develop our products. We'll look to you for leadership, insights, and methodologies that will help us translate our shared vision into a fantastic product.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Design skill.</strong> At the end of the day, the designs you create should look great and be easy to use. Help us make Gruntwork customers smile. :)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Domain expertise.</strong> We don't expect you to have a complete vision for our product on day 1, but to design products in our space, you must be able to thoroughly ramp up on our domain (DevOps, software delivery, cloud software, CI / CD, infrastructure as code).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bonus: HTML/CSS.</strong> If you can occasionally roll up your sleeves and work directly in HTML/CSS, you can help us make sure the final product is true to your vision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bonus: Software Background.</strong> If you happen to have prior experience in software engineering, working on dev tools, or other technical domains, that may give you special insight into how our product can delight the users.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, for this role, you'll be working with a team based in the USA/Canada (GMT-7 to GMT-3). We prefer to hire candidates located in the USA or Canada, but are open to hiring in any country within those time zones. Unfortunately, this role is not available outside the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones.</p>
