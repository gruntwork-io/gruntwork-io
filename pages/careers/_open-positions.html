      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on

        >
        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document tribal knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Sales Engineer</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Senior Sales Engineer</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Technical Account Executive</h3>

    <p>We're looking for a Senior Sales Engineer to be our first dedicated sales hire at Gruntwork. To date, we've asked a small number of cloud engineers to
      handle sales calls in addition to their core work. As our company and lead volume have grown, we've had to choose between being effective at sales or
      improving the product. Now we're looking to make our first dedicated sales hire whose 100% focus will be on educating customers, closing deals, and
      writing code/docs to help us close deals.</p>
    <p>As the first sales hire, you'll report directly to the founders and will have the opportunity to make considerable impact on the overall growth of the company.</p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> We receive a growing number of leads each month and are struggling to keep up. As our first dedicated sales hire, you'll roll up your sleeves and respond to leads, lead sales calls, and close the deals. You'll engage with some of the largest enterprise companies in the world — and throughout the world — as well as cutting-edge new startups.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact sales strategy at Gruntwork.</strong> Gruntwork has become a multi-million dollar company with no outside investment, no debt, and a few humble engineers doing sales on the side. Now we're ready to have a dedicated sales team and could use your help setting our strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve the sales pitch.</strong> Our sales presentation today involves Gruntwork engineers speaking to customer engineers with no slide deck needed. Customers love the detail and first-hand technical knowledge, but we want to transition to a standardized pitch that consistently works and that we can share with future sales hires. We'll look to you to help us craft it.</li>
      <li><strong>Streamline our sales workflow.</strong> You'll help us design a streamlined sales workflow that balances our need to captures key data in our CRM (currently salesforce) with our need for personal productivity and efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Light marketing.</strong> You'll primarily focus on converting qualified leads into signed contracts, but there may be low-hanging fruit opportunities to bring in more leads. We'll look to you to identify and coordinate those opportunities, backed by additional budget if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Lay the groundwork for a sales team.</strong> We'll work together to lay the groundwork for a future multi-person sales team. As you look to grow your career, you'll have the option to aspire to sales management, or leadership as an individual contributor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ability to sell.</strong> We can trust you to own all new opportunities ranging from small startups to large enterprises. You have confidence in your ability to effectively convert qualified leads to a signed contract. You have prior experience closing deals end-to-end with both small startups and large enterprises. </li>
      <li><strong>Technical understanding.</strong> You've played the role of technical expert in past roles. In this role, following your ramp up, you expect to have valuable technical information to offer customers, a clear mental model of what Gruntwork does, and answers to a common set of customer questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical skill.</strong> You can write code and build tools. You hate manual data entry so you write your own CLI tool to streamline it. You hate manually generating quotes, so you automate the CRM to do it. When customers point out gaps in the docs or product, you look forward to occasionally filling in those gaps to help close the deal.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> A core principle at Gruntwork is doing the right thing. We expect all Grunts to be honest and never compromise their integrity. We understand there's a natural pressure to close the deal, but we only sell products to customers when we genuinely believe they will be of value. You should feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus: Consulting skill.</strong> Sometimes general questions come up that call upon us to become temporary consultants. Or when speaking with large enterprises, you can speak thoughtfully at the level of broad industry trends. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>
